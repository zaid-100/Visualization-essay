    Data Visualization
    </h1>
    <p>
    Data is information. But what is visualization? Well, in his book, "interactive data visualization for the web", the author Scott Murray describes it as followed: <br>
        "Visualization is a process of mapping information to visuals". <br>
        Pretty straight forward right? almost repeats himself. But pay close attention to the word "mapping". The way we present our information matters a lot when visualizing, or "mapping" it.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    In the first two chapters the author gives some insight on how we can differentiate good visualizations from bad ones. For instance one visualization uses vector imaging and the other doesn't. compare the following 2 images as an example.
    </p>
    <div id="pic1">picture 1 </div>
    <div id="pic2">picture 2</div>
    <p>
    Notice how the second picture, being a vector image, is less distorted while the first picture, being a regular image, is distorted and doesn't fit the division properly with the CSS command "background-size: cover" <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Also notice how the second picture has the background color same as that of the page, which is because the entire picture is made from lines, points, and mathematical equations. It does not posess a "background color" of itself. Whereas the first image covers the background color of the webpage by all of its boundaries.
        <br>
        Also, if we were to zoom in on the first image to see the exact values presented on a graph, the distortions would make our estimates way off, whereas with vector imaging it'll be much more accurate as the distortions would be non-existant.
        <br>
        The second picture is actually just a better version of the first picture and is a great example to show us how much of a difference minute details can make. <br>
        If you wanted to make a visualization similar to the first one better, just look at the second mapping of the same information and try to incorporate vector imaging into the equation.
